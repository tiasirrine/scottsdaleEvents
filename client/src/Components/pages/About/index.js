						Founder and owner Cristina Stathakis recognized a need for luxury
						rentals in the corporate event market. Having been involved in over
						a thousand events since 2013, Cristina's eye for design craved
						something more from what was currently available in the marketplace.
						As a result, Scottsdale Event Decor came to life. Her love for
						beautiful events helped in the design of our collections.

						rental items that are designed and manufactured locally in our
						warehouse.
